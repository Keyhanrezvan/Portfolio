    <!--About Me-->
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a diligent and motivated person who loves the act of bringing ideas to life and creating things. At a young age, I fell in love with learning and spent my time learning about science fields as well as creating arts and crafts.</p>
    <p>Recently, I was accepted to Physician Assistant school, but after working in the healthcare field, I realized that my true interests lied in technology and its use to create products. I found myself having fun spending hours on my computer using various softwares to create web pages, graphics, and videos.</p>
    <p> I think being equipped with the skills to bring a website to life and designing it to meet the user's needs is a special ability and vital in today's world. A distinct trait of this field that excites me is the collarabative nature of the field which also allows many people to share ideas and build upon each other. </p>
    <p>A few of my recent accomplishments and endeavors include:</p>
    <!--Ordered list-->
    <ul>
      <li>Published clinical research study in a scientific journal</li>
      <li>Graduated Magna Cum Laude from Texas A&M University</li>
      <li>Own multiple social media accounts that produce millions of views</li>
      <li>Accepted to multiple PA schools</li>
    </ul>
